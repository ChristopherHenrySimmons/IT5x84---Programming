Analysis

1. Change WHILE loop to FOR loop.
2. Instead of using value 10 as loop counter, get the input from the user.
3. Use exception handling.
4. Change the output text of "Failure" to "Will keep trying".
5. Instead of using value 8 as count for passes, use percentage instead. When passes are less than 85%, display "Must try harder next time. No one should be left behind."
